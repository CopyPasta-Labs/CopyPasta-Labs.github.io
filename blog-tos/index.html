          <p><strong>CopyPasta Labs FZ-LLC - Cybersecurity Blog Subscription Service</strong></p>
<p><em>Last Updated: February 2026</em></p>
<h2 id="1-agreement-to-terms">1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
<p>By subscribing to CopyPasta Labs FZ-LLC (&ldquo;Company,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) cybersecurity blog writing service (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;), you (&ldquo;Client,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;) agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not subscribe to or use the Service.</p>
<h2 id="2-service-description">2. Service Description</h2>
<h3 id="21-what-we-provide">2.1 What We Provide</h3>
<p>The Service provides unlimited cybersecurity blog writing on a subscription basis. Requests are fulfilled one at a time in the order they are received (queue system).</p>
<h3 id="22-how-it-works">2.2 How It Works</h3>
<ul>
<li>You submit blog topics and briefs to a shared queue</li>
<li>We research and write one blog at a time</li>
<li>Each blog is expected to be completed within one (1) calendar month</li>
<li>Once a blog is approved or delivered, the next request in your queue begins</li>
<li>Revisions are unlimited until you are satisfied with the deliverable</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="23-deliverable-format">2.3 Deliverable Format</h3>
<p>Blog posts are delivered in your preferred format (Markdown, Google Doc, or other agreed format) unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h3 id="24-conference-presentation-support">2.4 Conference Presentation Support</h3>
<p>Content created for blogs may be adapted for use at security conferences such as BlackHat, DEF CON, and similar events. Upon request, we will work with you to facilitate conference talk submissions and presentations based on blog content. This work (including talk abstracts, slide decks, and presentation materials) is processed through the same queue system as blog requests—time spent on conference preparation is counted in lieu of generating new blog posts during that period.</p>
<h2 id="3-subscription-and-billing">3. Subscription and Billing</h2>
<h3 id="31-billing-cycle">3.1 Billing Cycle</h3>
<p>Subscriptions are billed monthly on a calendar month basis. Your subscription renews automatically on the same date each month until cancelled.</p>
<h3 id="32-payment">3.2 Payment</h3>
<p>Payment is processed through Stripe. You authorize us to charge your designated payment method for all subscription fees.</p>
<h3 id="33-price-changes">3.3 Price Changes</h3>
<p>Any changes to subscription pricing require your explicit written agreement. We will notify you of proposed price changes, and the new pricing will only take effect after you confirm your acceptance in writing (via email or instant message such as Slack or WhatsApp). If you do not agree to a price change, your subscription will continue at the current rate until cancelled.</p>
<h2 id="4-cancellation">4. Cancellation</h2>
<h3 id="41-how-to-cancel">4.1 How to Cancel</h3>
<p>You may cancel your subscription at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@copypastalabs.com">contact@copypastalabs.com</a> or through your Stripe customer portal.</p>
<h3 id="42-effect-of-cancellation">4.2 Effect of Cancellation</h3>
<p>Upon cancellation, your subscription remains active until the end of your current billing period. No partial refunds are issued for unused portions of a billing period.</p>
<h3 id="43-work-in-progress">4.3 Work in Progress</h3>
